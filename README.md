## Calculating Fitness Values

Maybe I got lucky with the placement of my platforms, because it doesn't feel 
like I changed much in the code. However, by removing some of the punishment in
the move function made the spaceships live longer. For a while these spaceships
would float around because I had made the punishment for crashing quite harsh. 
For a moment that was entertaining, however by adjusting the crash to be a punishment
but not so much so, and making landing a far higher reward, the ships started
trying to fall onto the platform and then stay put. And in my runs, many of them 
did a touch and stay, or touch and go. Though I may have just been lucky with 
my platform placements for that to happen.
